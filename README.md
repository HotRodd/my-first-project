# Cardio Good Fitness Project
This is my first Python project on the fundamentals of AIML. 
The objective of this project is to explore the dataset so I can get comfortable working in Python. Exploring the dataset to identify differences between the customers of each product. I will also explore the relationships between the different attributes of the customers. 

In this project I will do the following:
* Come up with a customer profile (characteristics of a customer) of the different products
* Perform univariate and multivariate anlyses
* Generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the company in targeting new customers.
